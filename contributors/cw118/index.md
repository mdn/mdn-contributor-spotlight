Hi there, Iâ€™m Carolyn. Iâ€™m a self-taught programmer and I love coding because it allows me to combine problem-solving and creativity. Growing up, I was surrounded by lots of unique cultures, learning and listening to multiple languages and working with different technologies. So open source matches my interests and values in many ways.

## How did you start using MDN?

I was looking for an open-source project to make my first contribution and as I was reading some CSS and JavaScript documentation on MDN Web Docs, I realized that itâ€™s open-source and began contributing to MDN.

## What do you like about the website?

MDN Web Docs is an indispensable resource for all web developers and makes knowledge of web technologies easily accessible to people around the world. Being an open-source project, itâ€™s also a community effort to write accurate and user-friendly documentation, and to keep the information up-to-date.

## Why do you contribute?

I started making contributions quite recently and I really enjoy it. Itâ€™s very gratifying to collaborate with the contributors and maintainers on MDN Web Docs, who are always helpful and welcoming (a special thank you to the French content team ðŸ˜€). I hope to guide new contributors as everyone here did for me.

Currently, I mainly contribute to the translated content. As someone who is multilingual and has many international experiences, localization is very important to me. Working with the kind and knowledgeable teams on MDN gives me the opportunity to learn, be part of a passionate community, and help improve an extraordinary resource.
