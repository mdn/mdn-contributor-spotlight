Hi all, my name is Michael. I work for a small nonprofit organization called [stiftung lebensqualität](https://stiftung-lq.net/) in Switzerland on a wide range of IT-related tasks. Out of all my tasks, I've always been most excited to work on web technologies.

## How did you start using MDN?

About ten years ago, when I started coding for the web, I used a search engine to look for explanations about HTML tags, CSS properties, and JS functions. Most of the time, I landed on a site called "MDN". I was fascinated by its massive amount of information. It didn't take me long to skip the "search the web" part and directly go to MDN whenever I needed to know something about web technologies. This hasn't changed since then.

## What do you like about the website?

Notwithstanding the fact that MDN Web Docs is a comprehensive resource of knowledge, has a clean writing style, and has a great design, I mostly like its openness. Did you spot a mistake or encounter an unclear description? Send a pull request. Do you have an idea for a new feature? Start a discussion. It's great that anyone motivated to improve MDN can contribute.

## Why do you contribute?

I’m primarily active on the Discourse forum, where [I help learners](https://discourse.mozilla.org/u/mikoMK) who are working through the [MDN Learning Area](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) by reviewing their exercises or answering general questions about web technologies. When I visited the forum some months ago and saw people helping each other, I thought, "This seems like a great way to give something back for the countless hours I spent on MDN!”. Helping others gives me the chance to improve and deepen my own understanding. It’s also great to see how learners get better and better with every exercise while working through the courses. Last but not least, it’s a great chance for me to improve my writing skills as a non-native English speaker.
