Hi, I'm Yuji, I am a web engineer in Japan. I mainly do back-end development, but sometimes I do front-end development as well.

## How did you start using MDN?

I use MDN Web Docs to learn the latest HTML/CSS/JavaScript specifications. I still use it at least once a day.

## What do you like about the website?

MDN Web Docs has the most up-to-date and accurate information and the content is presented in an easy-to-understand manner. I also like that it's available in many languages (very important!).

## What contribution stands out to you (or is your favorite)?

[Migrate CompatibilityTable to Compat macro](https://github.com/mdn/translated-content/issues/354). For the longest time, the browser compatibility tables for languages other than English were not updated because it was still using the old compatibility table. I wrote a batch migration script to replace all of these tables with the new Compat macros.

MDN Web Docs used to be a wiki, so I had to do it manually page by page. However, when MDN moved all of their content to GitHub in 2021 it enabled me to make this batch migration.

## Why do you contribute?

I'm worried about localized information being outdated. I'm not good at English, but I'm good at making scripts, so I hope I can continue to contribute.
