Hello, I'm HoChan Lee, a developer from South Korea and a member of MDN's Korean localization team ([yari-content-ko](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/teams/yari-content-ko)). My contributions span a variety of tasks related to Korean documentation, such as converting content from HTML to Markdown, removing Kumascript macros, participating in translation discussions, improving guides, and responding to inquiries.

In May 2021, I formed the yari-content-ko team with [seven colleagues](https://egas.tistory.com/16#yari-content-ko). I unfroze the ko-locale that had been frozen since 2020 when the MDN platform transitioned from Kuma to Yari, which had prevented further edits. Currently, our team is responsible for all aspects of localization, including updating legacy documents, reviewing content, and improving the contribution environment for Korean content.

I enjoy music and coffee, and I have a keen interest in 3D graphics. In my free time, I love to go sports climbing, explore great food spots, and take photos with my girlfriend.

## How did you start using MDN?

While studying JavaScript, I naturally discovered MDN Web Docs. It simplifies the content of standard specifications from organizations like W3C, ECMA, and WHATWG, making them accessible even to beginners. In Korea, MDN Web Docs is widely regarded as equivalent to the official standard documentation and is frequently cited in various writings.

## What do you like about MDN?

What I value most about MDN Web Docs is its reliability. Experts continually refine and discuss the content to ensure accurate and up-to-date information is always available. Plus, anyone interested can contribute to this process. It's a comprehensive resource that covers a vast range of web technologies.

## Why do you contribute to Open Source or MDN?

I contribute to MDN to improve the outdated and often inaccurate Korean documentation. When I first submitted a [PR to fix a typo](https://github.com/mdn/translated-content/pull/295), I learned that the Korean locale was frozen and needed a proposal and a team to be unfrozen. Also, it was disheartening to see critical sections marked as inaccurate, with instructions to refer to the English version.

To address this, I gathered a team, submitted a proposal, and reached out to MDN admins (thanks to [Chris Mills](https://x.com/chrisdavidmills)), which led to a positive response. Despite the many challenges, I’m committed to ensuring that the hard work of past contributors continues to be respected, which motivates me to keep contributing.

## What do you enjoy about contributing to MDN?

What captivates me the most is how interacting with diverse people broadens my perspective. MDN Web Docs is open-source and accessible to everyone, fostering an inclusive environment. Through tackling various issues on MDN, I’ve had the chance to connect with people worldwide and learn best practices in open source.

There are limits to what you can achieve alone, and it's impossible to do everything yourself. In a community, we can build together. We learn to respect each other's contributions, share our thoughts, and figure out how to move forward collectively. Early in the ko-locale, one of our key focuses was creating guides to make participation easy for everyone.
