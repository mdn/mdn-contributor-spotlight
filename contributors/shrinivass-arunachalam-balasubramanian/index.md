My name is Shrinivass Arunachalam Balasubramanian and I am from Boston, MA, USA, working as a Senior Full Stack Engineer at Fidelity Investments. I have been contributing to MDN Web Docs for over a year, diving into documentation updates like the CSS `:has()` selector performance tips and `DOMContentLoaded` clarifications etc. My areas of passion are front-end optimization, AI web tools, and ethical tech. This is evident in my open source project `reactive-lint` (over 500 downloads) as well as my IEEE I2ITCON 2025 Best Paper Award for "GovernAI". My 9+ industry experience also includes significant time with Angular, React, and Node.js at Nielsen and In4mation Insights. I enjoy dancing (freestyle) and playing tennis, which keep me energized and balanced. My journey from a rural Indian village to a Master's at UMass Dartmouth (2016) inspires my pursuit to make technology impactful and accessible around the world.

## How did you start using MDN?

Back in college, I started resolving JS challenges on my projects and came to MDN for the first time as a student in Chennai. At the time, I was overwhelmed by scattered resources, and MDN stood out for its accuracy and developer-centric explanations. We don't have AI like we have now, which sometimes explains code or bugs. For me, MDN has been there all the way, assisting my evolution as a developer. It's my daily reference and guides my work on `reactive-lint` and my other contributions.

## What do you like about MDN?

I really appreciate how MDN combines depth and accessibility. From an inexperienced individual to an advanced programmer, you can meet your information needs in an unambiguous and organized manner. It's a pleasure to engage with people, whether you're resolving GitHub issues about CSS content, or mastering new application programming interfaces (APIs). What makes it a pleasure is the project's collaborative spirit, interactive examples, as well as the community interaction.

## Why do you contribute to Open Source or MDN?

MDN shaped my career, and I wanted to give back to the community that shaped me. Contributing to MDN ensures developers worldwide from students to senior engineers can build on a shared, trusted foundation. For me, it's also about mentorship at scale; each improvement I make potentially helps thousands of developers solve a problem faster.

## What do you enjoy about contributing to MDN?

I find the collaboration aspect of this work very enjoyable. It's fulfilling to work with the community, refine PRs with insightful comments from people like [Chris Mills](https://github.com/chrisdavidmills), and witness the impact of those modifications on developers globally. This is the intersection of a technical challenge and community enthusiasm. It is particularly rewarding to know that even small, incremental work can make a big difference. This is what continually motivates me.
