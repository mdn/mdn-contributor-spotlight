Hi, I'm YiTao Yin, a graduate student in the Software Engineering program from China. I'm interested in solving problems by coding and learning new technologies.

## How did you start using MDN?

When I first wrote some HTML with VS Code, I noticed built-in help references MDN's web API docs. I was curious about it and started to read some articles. Then I found that MDN Web Docs is an open-source project, and we can conveniently improve the documentation. I started contributing to the project, from fixing typos to translating articles.

## What do you like about the website?

MDN Web Docs has built the most extensive documentation site about web technologies. People can start from scratch and learn almost everything they need for web development.

## What contribution stands out to you (or is your favorite)?

Now, I mainly contribute to the translation content. Localization of Web docs is very beneficial for readers from different countries. Working with the grateful MDN Web Docs team, I could learn more about web development.

## Why do you contribute?

There are millions of web developers in China, and many of them begin their developer journey at MDN Web Docs. Contributing to MDN Web Docs is an excellent way to help people who are starting out. Also, I can improve my English writing skills.
